# Browser Fighting Game

Author: Sam Thompson

This is an attempt at making an in-browser fighting game where all characters with customizable data-driven characters whose sprites and interactions with other entities are determined by their data files. The eventual goal is that you can create your own character data file and play with it online.

## How to run it

### Build the client
```
cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd..
```

If you have the Heroku CLI:
```
heroku local
```
